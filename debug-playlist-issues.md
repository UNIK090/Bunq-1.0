# Playlist Deletion Debug Guide

## Common Issues That Could Prevent Playlist Deletion:

### 1. **LocalStorage Issues**
- Check if localStorage is working properly
- Verify the storage key: `youtube-learning-tracker-storage`
- Ensure no quota limits are being hit

### 2. **UI Interaction Problems**
- Click events not registering properly
- Menu not closing after selection
- Confirmation dialog not showing

### 3. **State Management Issues**
- Zustand store not updating properly
- Persistence middleware issues
- Race conditions in state updates

### 4. **Browser Console Errors**
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
- Look for TypeScript compilation errors
- Verify no network issues with external dependencies

## Steps to Debug:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for any error messages when trying to delete a playlist.

### 2. Verify localStorage
Run this in browser console:
```javascript
// Check if localStorage is working
console.log('LocalStorage available:', !!window.localStorage);

// Check current playlists data
const stored = localStorage.getItem('youtube-learning-tracker-storage');
if (stored) {
  const data = JSON.parse(stored);
  console.log('Current playlists:', data.state.playlists);
}
```

### 3. Test Click Events
Ensure the delete button is actually triggering the click event.

### 4. Check Zustand Store
Verify the store is properly initialized and updating:
```javascript
// In browser console after importing store
const store = useAppStore.getState();
console.log('Current playlists in store:', store.playlists);
```

## Quick Fixes to Try:

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
2. **Restart the development server**
3. **Check for any JavaScript errors in console**
4. **Verify the playlist ID format matches what's expected**

If the issue persists, there might be a specific bug in the component rendering or event handling that needs investigation.
